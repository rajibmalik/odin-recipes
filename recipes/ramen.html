    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Stir-fried ramen with chicken or your choice of meat. Using chopsticks
        makes cooking this super easy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The trick to this recipe is to keep the food moving - especially
        the ramen. This recipe is fully customizable. I used soy sauce-flavored 
        ramen. I also replace 1 tablespoon of ramen water with an equal amount of 
        sake, this adds a phenomenal flavor. Fresh veggies can be used for best 
        results, but I used frozen vegetables for the convenience. I also used 
        pork bits for my meat but you could also use boneless, skinless chicken thighs,
        diced.
      </p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) package ramen noodles with seasoning packet</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil, divided</li>
        <li>8 ounces skinless, boneless chicken breast, diced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups frozen mixed vegetables</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic, divided</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place ramen noodles in a bowl. Set seasoning packet aside. Pour boiling water over noodles until 
          they are submerged; set aside while you start the stir-fry.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat, swirling to coat the entire pan. Add chicken and stir to coat with oil. Add oyster sauce and 1 tablespoon soy sauce. Stir-fry 
          chicken until no longer pink and juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add frozen vegetables. Cover, reduce heat to medium, and let steam until heated through and soft, about 5 minutes. Add ginger and 1 teaspoon minced garlic; stir-fry until fragrant, about 1 minute.
          Transfer mixture to a serving bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drain softened ramen noodles, reserving 2 tablespoons soaking water.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat remaining sesame oil in a pan over medium heat. Add reserved soaking water along with 1/2 of the ramen seasoning packet,
          remaining soy sauce, remaining garlic, and chili powder.
          Add ramen noodles; cook and stir constantly until coated and water has evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer to serving bowls and top with chicken and vegetable mixture.</li>
      </ol>
