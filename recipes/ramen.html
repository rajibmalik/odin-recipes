    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Stir-fried ramen with chicken or your choice of meat. Using chopsticks
        makes cooking this super easy.

        The trick to this recipe is to keep the food moving - especially
        the ramen. This recipe is fully customizable. I used soy sauce-flavored 
        ramen. I also replace 1 tablespoon of ramen water with an equal amount of 
        sake, this adds a phenomenal flavor. Fresh veggies can be used for best 
        results, but I used frozen vegetables for the convenience. I also used 
        pork bits for my meat but you could also use boneless, skinless chicken thighs,
        diced.
