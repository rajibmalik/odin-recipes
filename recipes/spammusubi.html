    <h2 class="sub-header">Description</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Spam musubi is a popular snack in Hawaii. It is a type of sushi that features marinated cooked Spam.
        I got this recipe from a local Hawaiian friend when I was living there.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-header">Ingredients</h3>
      <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>2 cups uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) container fully cooked luncheon meat (such as Spam)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>5 sheets sushi nori (dry seaweed)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="sub-header">Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Soak uncooked rice in water to cover for 4 hours; drain and rinse.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add rice and stir.
          Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove pan from heat and stir in rice vinegar. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li> 
          Stir together sugar, soy sauce, and oyster sauce in a medium bowl until sugar is completely dissolved.
          Slice luncheon meat lengthwise into 10 slices, or to desired thickness, and marinate in sauce for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
          Cook slices until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cut nori sheets in half and lay on a flat work surface.
          Place a rice press in the center of a sheet, and press rice tightly inside. Top with a slice of luncheon meat, and remove press.
          Wrap nori around rice, sealing edges with a small amount of water.
          (Rice may also be formed by hand in the shape of the meat slices and about 1-inch thick.)
        </li>
        <li>Serve musubi warm or chilled.</li>
      </ol>
