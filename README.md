# Basic Recipe Website
# Aims of the project
* Create a functioning recipe website with a simple brutalist web design using only HTML 

# Reflection
Creating a very basic brutalist website was not especially challenging but it was a good experience to get a better fundamental understanding of the usage of fundamental HTML tags. I also added a basic external CSS stylesheet to get more familiar with linking CSS to HTML. This has served me well going forward into more realistic web design. I have considered using flexbox to make the pages more presentable. At this moment I will practice flexbox on another repository.

One thing I did find challenging was effective use of commits especially as this was a simple project which did not include programming. This is something to focus on going forward.
